# F5-Disabling-Enabling-Pool-Members

This script will intake the Nodes that you input, then will Disable all those Nodes and wait for your input to re-enable them and then will enable them all at one go. This will be helpful when you have a large number of Nodes that you need to service and hence take out of the Pool first before servicing them
